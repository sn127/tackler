== Developer Certificate of Origin

Your pull requests can be merged only if you can certify 
the link:../DCO[Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO), Version 1.1].
To certify DCO (e.g. sign-off your commit), you must add 
a `Signed-off-by` line to **every**  git commit message 
(e.g. by using `git commit -s`):

    Signed-off-by: github-account <your.real@email.address>

If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` in git configs,
then git will include that line for you with `git commit -s`. 
These settings can be done per repository basis, 
so they don't have be global settings in your system. 
 
Please make sure that you sign-off all your PR's commits.
