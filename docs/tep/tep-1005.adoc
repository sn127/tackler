= TEP-1005: TXN Filter

Transaction filters are used to filter txn stream based on transaction's attributes.

Transaction filters can be used to define which transactions will be fed to the accounting engine.
If transaction is filtered out, it will be disappear from transaction stream and vanish from
engine's perspective. So it would not be part of any calculations or reports.

The main usage for this feature is server interface at the moment.


== Journal file format

No journal file changes.

== CLI changes

There will be command line option to feed filter definition to the engine for testing purposes.

* [x] `--api-filter-def` Filter definition as json


== CONF changes

No configuration settings for filters.


== Machinery

There will be changes to the machine.

* [x] Translate filter definition to actual filter
* [x] Apply filter to the txn-stream


=== API changes

Server and client API will be changed to support filters.

== Exporting

Initial implementation of filters does not support Exports.

=== Equity export

No changes to equity export

=== Identity export

No changes to identity export

== Documentation

* [x] link:../../CHANGELOG[]: add new item
* [x] User docs
** [x] user manual
*** [x] cli-arguments
**** [x] `--api-filter-def`
* [x] Developer docs
** [x] API changes
*** [x] Server API changes
*** [x] Client API changes
** [x] Add metadata example to JSON doc (git-and-filter-01)


== Future plans and Postponed (PP) features

* Support filtering with exports.
* Support XOR-filter trees
* API objects for JS

=== Postponed (PP) features

* [x] Client API model objects for filters
* [x] Better JSON representation in metadata
* [PP] perf: Performance test with filtering enabled
* [PP] perf: Run all tests with filtering engine (while no active filters)


== Tests

Normal, ok-case tests to validate functionality:

* [x] filter json def
* [x] report metadata with filters
** [x] text
** [x] json
* [x] reports
** [x] balance report's metadata
** [x] balance-group report's metadata
** [x] register report's metadata
* [x] filter tree
** [x] logical nodes
*** [x] *`AND`*
*** [x] *`OR`*
*** [x] *`NOT`*
** [x] leaves
*** [x] Transcation header
**** [x] *`timestamp`*, ZonedDateTime
***** [x] *`begin`*, ZonedDateTime
***** [x] *`end`*, ZonedDateTime
**** [x] *`code`*, String
**** [x] *`description`*, String
**** [x] *`uuid`*, String
**** [x] *`comments`*, String
*** [x] Postings
**** [x] *`account`*, String
**** [x] `amount`, (account, amount: String + BigDecimal)
***** [x] `amount:exact`, BigDecimal
***** [x] `amount:less`, BigDecimal
***** [x] `amount:greater`, BigDecimal
**** [x] *`commodity`*, String
**** [x] *`comment`*, String


=== Errors

Tests for error cases:

* [x] e: Invalid filter definition
* [x] e: Result set after filtering is empty


=== Perf

Is there need to run or create new perf tests?

* [PP] perf: Performance test with filtering enabled
* [PP] perf: Run all tests with filtering engine (while no active filters)
