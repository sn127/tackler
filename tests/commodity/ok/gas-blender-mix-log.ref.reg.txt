            ; Gas:He:Tank·102  Why is this '-' delta (neg)?
            ; negative deltas would be better with starting pressures
            ; e.g.: 247 -273 = -26 as tank delta
            ; and (298 -25) -26 = 247 as end pressure
            ; Also then user will see positive pressures, 
            ; and rest of accunting will make more sense
