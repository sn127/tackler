= Tackler Test Tracking Database (T3DB)

Tackler has test tracking "database" for test coverage tracking.

It's collection of YAML files, where features, error and success case 
tests are tracked.

Main purpose of the database is that it to try to find features 
which are not tested at all, trying to find minimal amount of overlapping 
tests for desired test coverage and trying to find duplicate tests.

It also provides reverse mapping from test to features which are tested 
by that test.
