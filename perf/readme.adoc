= Tackler performance test setup

This directory contains tools and reference results for Tackler's performance testing.

Performance test data is generated by by link:../tools/generator[generator] tool.
Tools to run perf tests are located in link:./bin[bin].

See link:./results[Readme for results] for description of used hardware
and actual pref test results.

With bigger datasets it is good idea to put this whole perf directory outside 
of Tackler project directory.  If 1E5-1E6 datasets are inside project's directory, 
your IDE might go nuts while it scans new files.
